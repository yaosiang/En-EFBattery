En-EFBattery
============
Introduction
------------
This battery are trying to implement all tasks in [Miyake et al.'s research (2000)](http://psy2.ucsd.edu/~dhuber/miyake_2000.pdf) by using [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/) R2009b later and [Psychtoolbox 3](http://psychtoolbox.org/).

The tasks were selected to tap three executive functions: (a) shifting between task or mental sets, (b) updating and monitoring of working memory representations and (c) inhibition of dominant or prepotent responses.

The purpose of implementation is for my master thesis.

Task List
---------
Shifting

- Plus-Minus Task
- Number-Letter Task
- Local-Global Task

Updating

- Keep Track Task
- Tone Monitoring Task
- Letter Memory Task

Inhibition

- Antisaccade Task
- Stop-Signal Task
- Stroop Task

Note
----

Antisaccade Task did not follow the Miyake et al.'s original paper. Instead, I follow [Kane et al. (2001)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11409097) experiment 1. The reason why I change the implementation is simple. Because I read the Kane et al.'s paper first and the procedure between Miyake et al. and Kane et al. are similar.
