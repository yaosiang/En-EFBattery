En-EFBattery
============
This battery are trying to implement all tasks in Miyake et al.'s research (2000) by using MATLAB R2007a and Psychtoolbox extension. The tasks were selected to tap three executive functions: (a) shifting between task or mental sets, (b) updating and monitoring of working memory representations and (c) inhibition of dominant or prepotent responses. The purpose of implementation is for my master thesis.

Task List
Shifting
  Plus-Minus Task
  Number-Letter Task
  Local-Global Task
Updating
  Keep Track Task
  Tone Monitoring Task
  Letter Memory Task
Inhibition
  Antisaccade Task
  Stop-Signal Task
  Stroop Task

Notes
Antisaccade Task did not follow the Miyake et al.'s original paper. Instead, I follow Kane et al. (2001) experiment 1. The reason why I change the implementation is simple. Because I read the Kane et al.'s paper first and the procedure between Miyake et al. and Kane et al. are similar.
